1. Start with creating all html page files
   - Home (Index)
   - Menu
   - Gallery
   - Reviews
   - Reservation
   - Contact
   - about

2. all pages will have very similar format, style css will be very similar
   - Resizing tab
   - Different selectable pages, header fixed to the top of the pages
   - all pages will have a main title with a unique bg img
   - all pages will have the same footer which includes; social media links, other 
     selectable pages (about, contact, gallery, reviews & website accessibility assist). 
     The footer will always be 1 colour (no bg img)
   - all pages will have the restaurant name on the top left of the page (fixed)

Process of developing the Lancaster Restaurant Website:
   1. Design the draft of the page(s)
   2. Develop HTML, then CSS & JS
   3. Start with the header, title & footer, as all pages on the website will have the similar design &/ interaction
   4. Think in the perspective of the reader; what do they want to see in terms of what they are looking for? (Pictures say a thousand words)
   5. Re-use some css & js code as styling & interaction can be repetitive
   6. Use and reference fonts used
   7. Keep in mind !!accessibility!!
   8. Some ideas were scratched, having links at the footer will be hard for the user to constantly scroll down
